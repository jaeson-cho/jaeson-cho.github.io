	<h3>Favorite CMSC Subject:</h3>
	<p>CMSC 150. Despite its difficulty I can say that CMSC 150 was one of the courses that made me engage more and be excited from the possibilities that they can be applied to. CMSC 150 was also a fun process to code because you get to integrate mathematical knowledge to your coding skills.</p>
	<h3>Favorite GE so far: </h3>
	<p> DEFINITELY STS10. It's not the best when it comes to lectures per se...but the encounter there, good lord. </p>
	<h3>Favorite PL and why:</h3>
	<p>Albeit the long time since I last used it, my favorite progamming language, without a doubt is Java. Being able to model concepts into objects makes concepts easier to wrap your head about.</p>
	<h3>Favorit Food:</h3>
	<p>Adobo has long been my de facto answer towards what my favorite food is. It grew on me. My whole childhood is wrapped around me loving my lola's adobo. Because of this I have a habit of usually ordering adobo in an eatery I've just discoverd.</p>
	<h3>Hobbies:</h3>
	<p>I generally have a lot of hobbies. I like playing the guitar and listening to music whenever i feel artsy. And whenever I feel like moving around I do judo or hike up a mountain. I belong to both the UPLB judo varsity and UPLB Mountaineers. Although it has been some time since I last trained. I also like playing games when I'm indoors. Usually rpgs, jrpgs, or simulations are my thing, but whenever I feel too bored to play I either read novels/books or just watch anime/kdrama/western series.</p>
	<h3>What was your childhood dream</h3>
	<p>My childhood dream was something very very simple. It mattered what not path I take, nor the choices I make. What consisted mainly of my dream was a simple and happy future. This can come in a lot of forms and is honestly very vague, but a dream's a dream</p>
